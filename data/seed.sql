'Jane Austen on Film and Television','Sue Parrill',
'Jane Austen’s career as a novelist began in 1811 with the publication
 of Sense and Sensibility. Her work was finally adapted for the big screen with 
 the 1940 filming of Pride and Prejudice (very successful at the box office). No other 
 film adaptation of an Austen novel was made for theatrical release until 1995. Amazingly,
during 1995 and 1996, six film and television adaptations appeared, first Clueless, then Persuasion,
followed by Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, the Miramax Emma, and the Meridian/A&E Emma.
This book traces the history of film and television adaptations (nearly 30 to date) of Jane Austen
manuscripts, compares the adaptations to the manuscripts, compares the way different adaptations treat
the novels, and analyzes the adaptations as examples of cinematic art. The first of seven chapters
explains why the novels of Jane Austen have become a popular source of film and television adaptations.
The following six chapters each cover one of Austen’s novels: Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice,
Emma, Mansfield Park, Persuasion, and Northanger Abbey. Each chapter begins with a summary of the main 
events of the novel. Then a history of the adaptations is presented followed by an analysis of the unique
qualities of each adaptation, a comparison of these adaptations to each other and to the novels on which
they are based, and a reflection of relevant film and literary criticism as it applies to the adaptations.');
